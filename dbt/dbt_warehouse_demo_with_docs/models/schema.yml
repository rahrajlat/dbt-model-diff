models:
  - name: int_order_agg
    description: The `int_order_agg` model aggregates order items to calculate 
      total order values and item counts, providing a summary of orders by 
      customer and date. It reads from staging orders data in `stg_order_items` 
      and joins it with the intermediate orders table `int_orders`, which 
      contains customer information. The main transformation is aggregating 
      order items by order ID, calculating sums for line totals and quantities, 
      and then joining this aggregated data with the orders table to include 
      additional details like order dates, statuses, and customer IDs. This 
      model operates at a grain of one row per order, offering insights into 
      total sales and item counts for each order. Analysts can use this dataset 
      to analyze customer purchasing behavior, track sales performance over 
      time, or identify trends in order volumes by region.
    columns:

          a related table or database field, possibly through a join operation with
          another model, as it appears to be aggregated alongside other order-related
          metrics."
      - name: country
        description: The `country` column represents a categorical value 
          indicating the geographic location of an order. It is likely derived 
          from a related table, such as customer information or shipping 
          details, and is used to group orders by their country of origin.
      - name: item_count
        description: The `item_count` column represents the total number of 
          items in each order, aggregated across all relevant transactions. This
          value is calculated by summing up the quantity of individual items 
          within each order, providing a count of unique items per order.
      - name: order_total
        description: The `order_total` column represents the total amount spent 
          by a customer on an individual order. It is calculated by aggregating 
          the values of various order items, likely including product prices and
          quantities.
  - name: dim_customers
    description: The `dim_customers` model represents a customer dimension 
      dataset used in business intelligence and reporting. It reads from the 
      intermediate "int_customers" table, which aggregates or transforms staging
      data into a standardized format for analysis. The model does not apply any
      additional filters or calculations; it simply selects all available 
      columns from this intermediate table. As a result, the output has one row 
      per customer, providing detailed information about each individual 
      customer. Analysts and downstream models can use this dataset to analyze

          is likely used to tailor marketing efforts, product offerings, or 
          support services to specific regions or languages.
  - name: stg_products
    description: The `stg_products` model represents a staging process that 
      aggregates product information from the "products" table in the database. 
      It reads from this staging area, transforming raw product data into a 
      standardized format for analysis and reporting purposes. The main 
      transformations include standardizing product names and categories to 
      title case, converting list prices to a consistent numeric format, and 
      casting product IDs as integers. This model maintains one row per unique 
      product, providing a detailed view of each item in the catalog. Analysts 
      can use this dataset to analyze product offerings, pricing strategies, or 
      customer preferences by product category.

  - name: int_customers
    description: The `int_customers` model represents the customer dimension 
      dataset, which captures key information about customers in the system. It 
      reads from the staging layer, specifically the "stg_customers" table, 
      which contains raw customer data. The model transforms this data by 
      applying a simple conditional logic to determine the locale based on the 
      country of origin, effectively categorizing customers into 
      English-speaking regions (UK and US). This results in a dataset with one 
      row per customer, providing a detailed view of each individual's 
      attributes. Analysts can use this dataset to analyze customer behavior, 
      segment markets, or perform other customer-centric analyses downstream.
